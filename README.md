# PacMen-Exercise
This exercise generates images of the classic PacMan game that are populated with the click of a button and they randomly bounce around the walls of the screen with another button click. This program originated from the MIT X-pro MERN full stack development program.

<h4>To Run this Program</h4>

In order to run this file, open the index.html file in a browser. Then click the button at the top left-hand side of the screen to create PacMen. You can create as many as you want. When you click the Start Game, the PacMen will begin to move in random directions and speeds bouncing all over the screen.

<h4>Future RoadMap</h4>

This program can be still be enhanced by making the PacMen images change as they move opening and closing their mouths and changing the direction they are facing to always match the direction they are moving in. Another idea would be to add some other classic PacMan images and make the PacMen also move around the new objects.
